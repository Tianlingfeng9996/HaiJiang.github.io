I'm a third year phd student from [Department of Mechanical and Intelligent Systems Engineering](https://www-uec-ac-jp.translate.goog/education/graduate/m/?_x_tr_sl=ja&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=zh-CN), [the University of Electro-Communications](https://www-uec-ac-jp.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=ja&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=zh-CN). My research interest includes biomedical signal processing, robotics, prosthetics and machine learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hiroshi Yokoi](https://researchmap.jp/yokoihiroshi/?lang=en) from the University of Electro-Communivations.
